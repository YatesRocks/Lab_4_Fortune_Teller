# Requirements
**Top Panel**: Title with a JLabel reading 'Fortune Teller' with an
`ImageIcon` depicting a fortune-teller icon sourced from 

**Middle Panel**: A `JTextArea` or similar depicting the fortunes

**Bottom Panel**: Two buttons, "Read My Fortune!" and "Quit".

Reading a fortune _appends_ to the text area, and fortunes are not to be
repeated twice in a row. Create separate fonts for title, buttons, and display.
The program must be reasonably visually appealing.
